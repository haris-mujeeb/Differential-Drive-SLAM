# ROS2 Gazebo Differential Drive Control & Localization

This repository is my personal workspace for learning Differential Drive Map & Localization by following the **"Self-Driving and ROS 2 - Learn by Doing! Map & Localization"** tutorial by [AntoBrandi](https://github.com/AntoBrandi).

The main goal is to implement and understand the concepts of localisation and mapping for a mobile robot using ROS 2. Each package in this workspace serves as a module for a specific functionality, and each contains its own `README.md` with detailed notes on the concepts I've learned.
